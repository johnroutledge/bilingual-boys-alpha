# Bilingual Boys
User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project.

This website is the go-to site for any Thai family thinking of moving to the UK. It provides a realistic and up-to-date view
of what life in the UK is like for Thai families, what the visa requirements and procedures are and also essential survival 
English language help.

While there are a seemingly endless supply of English teaching resources flooding the internet, as well as a plethora of UK 
immigration services, the USP of this website is that it combines both of these from the perspective of a Thai/English family 
which has first-hand experience of the whole process. Being both in Thai and English, it is accessible to both Thai and English
speakers alike.
